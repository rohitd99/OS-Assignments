# ðŸ‘‹ Hi , this is a repo of my Operating Systems course lab

It has all the C/C++ implementations of the assignments handed out during the course.

A brief about the Assignments :

1. ASSIGNMENT - 1 :

   A program for simulating system calls such as grep, cp, ls using fork and exec.

2. ASSIGNMENT - 2 :

   A program for opening and reading from a directory.

3. ASSIGNMENT - 3 :

   Programs implementing various CPU scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Prioriy Based.

4. ASSIGNMENT - 4 :

   A program for priority based round-robin algorithm.

5. ASSIGNMENT - 5 :

   A program for implementing two way communication using pipes and implementing redirection.

6. ASSIGNMENT - 6 :

   Solving the reader-writer synchronization problem using semaphores.

7. ASSIGNMENT - 7 :

   Solving the reader-writer synchronization problem using semaphore and mutex lock.

8. ASSIGNMENT - 8 :

   Implementation of Banker's Algorithm and Resource Allocation Algorithm.

9. ASSIGNMENT - 9 :

   Implementation of Memory Allocation algorithms (Best-Fit, Next-Fit, Best-Fit, Worst-Fit)

10. ASSIGNMENT - 10 :

    Program for Page replacement algorithms (LRU, Optimal etc)

11. ASSIGNMENT - 12 :

    Program for disk scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, CSCAN, LOOK, CLOOK)

Feel free to suggest any issues or changes.
