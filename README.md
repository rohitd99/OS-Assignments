# ðŸ‘‹ Hi , this is a repo of my Operating Systems course lab

It has all the C/C++ implementations of the assignments handed out during the course.

A brief about the Assignments :

- ASSIGNMENT - 1 :

  A program for simulating system calls such as grep, cp, ls using fork and exec.

- ASSIGNMENT - 2 :

  A program for opening and reading from a directory.

- ASSIGNMENT - 3 :

  Programs implementing various CPU scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Prioriy Based.

- ASSIGNMENT - 4 :

  A program for priority based round-robin algorithm.

- ASSIGNMENT - 5 :

  A program for implementing two way communication using pipes and implementing redirection.

- ASSIGNMENT - 6 :

  Solving the reader-writer synchronization problem using semaphores.

- ASSIGNMENT - 7 :

  Solving the reader-writer synchronization problem using semaphore and mutex lock.

- ASSIGNMENT - 8 :

  Implementation of Banker's Algorithm and Resource Allocation Algorithm.

- ASSIGNMENT - 9 :

  Implementation of Memory Allocation algorithms (Best-Fit, Next-Fit, Best-Fit, Worst-Fit)

- ASSIGNMENT - 10 :

  Program for Page replacement algorithms (LRU, Optimal etc)

- ASSIGNMENT - 12 :

  Program for disk scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, CSCAN, LOOK, CLOOK)
